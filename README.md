# Pleiades Reporter

Create and disseminate reports on Pleiades developments.

## Roadmap:

- [ ] Find and report on new records added to Zotero
    - [x] Use Zotero API to get records changed since a particular version and date
    - [ ] Cache the last version and date checked, so each time we run we start from there
    - [ ] Create formatted reports for each new Zotero record (including citation)

- [ ] Create a process to run checks periodically

- [ ] Create a textual UI to the check process to control it and review possible reports

- [ ] Post reports via the Mastodon API to the Pleiades gazetteer Fediverse account
